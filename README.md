Install node.js, and a node module manager so that after you pull the repo you can run npm i to install express. Then you'll be able to get the project up and running.

## Usage

After installing all the needed components you can run node server.js in the main repo folder. 
You can use this app to look at notes and keep tabs on tasks that you might need to do throughout the day. It's very versitile in that the notes don't need to be overly specific as long as they have a title and text you can put whatever you'd like
